![App Logo](fc6e0121a0b840d2a8dad3e67ccfdec2.png)

Welcome to the repository of the Car Workshop Communication App! This application is built using Python and Django, aiming to facilitate the car repair process by allowing customers to track repair status and approve repair costs.

## How it works?

The application consists of two main modules:

1. **Customer Panel**: Customers will have access to their accounts where they can check the status of their car repairs. They will receive notifications about repair progress and feedback from mechanics. Customers will be able to approve repair costs and communicate with the workshop.

2. **Workshop Panel**: The workshop will manage its profile where it can view customer repair requests and their current status. Mechanics will update repair progress, propose costs, and communicate with customers regarding their repairs.

## Main features of the application:

- User registration and login for both customers and the workshop.
- Adding and managing customer vehicle data.
- Real-time monitoring of repair status for customers.
- Notifications to customers about changes in repair status.
- Seamless communication between customers and the workshop.
- Approval and acceptance of repair costs.
- Generating repair reports and history.

## Technical Requirements:

- The application will follow a client-server architecture.
- We will use the Python programming language along with the Django framework for the backend.
- [Here, mention any preferred frontend technologies.]
- Data will be stored in [mention the preferred type of database].
- For improved scalability, we plan to use [mention preferred scalability solutions].
